# The West Wing Philosophy

## Why This Name

In *The West Wing*, CJ Cregg was the person who synthesized complexity into clarity. As Press Secretary and later Chief of Staff, she took the full weight of what was happening and communicated it - directly, intelligently, with no BS. She understood the whole picture and delivered what mattered.

That's the energy this system aims for.

## Why This Exists

Traditional productivity systems assume consistent energy, linear task completion, and uniform prioritization. They work well for people whose lives fit that model.

For everyone else - people managing health conditions, navigating career transitions, juggling creative work with day jobs, or simply having variable energy and focus - these systems often create more guilt than progress.

This project takes a different approach: **context-aware, adaptive structure**.

## Core Principles

### 1. You're the President, Not the Intern

You're running a complex operation. You shouldn't be managing checkbox lists - you should be getting briefings. The shift from "what tasks are due" to "what actually matters today given everything I'm dealing with" is fundamental.

### 2. Capture Should Be Frictionless

The biggest failure point of any system is getting information into it. If capture requires opening an app, navigating to the right place, and formatting correctly - you won't do it consistently.

Solution: Plain text files. Write however you naturally think. Claudia (the AI) handles structure.

### 3. Context Is Everything

"Call the insurance company" means something different when:
- You're well-rested and focused
- You're dealing with a health issue
- You just got difficult news at work
- You're traveling vs. at home

The same task, at different moments, has different priority. A good chief of staff knows this. Generic task lists don't.

### 4. Patterns > Snapshots

Knowing you're tired today is useful. Knowing that you're typically tired on Mondays after busy weekends is actionable insight.

The system tracks patterns over time:
- Energy and capacity trends
- Tasks that get repeatedly avoided (friction indicators)
- Correlations between different life areas
- What conditions lead to your best work

### 5. Structure Serves You, Not Vice Versa

You shouldn't have to change how you think to fit a system. The system should adapt to:
- Your energy level today
- Your location and context
- Your current life phase
- What's actually blocking you

### 6. You Own Your Data

- Local files, not trapped in a SaaS
- Exportable at any time
- Notion as backend (you control the workspace)
- No vendor lock-in

## The Claudia Test

Before adding any feature, ask: "Would Claudia do this?"

Claudia wouldn't:
- Send you 47 reminder notifications
- Make you feel guilty about unchecked boxes
- Treat all tasks as equal
- Ignore the fact that you're stressed
- Give you generic productivity advice

Claudia would:
- Walk in with the three things that actually matter today
- Notice you've been avoiding something and bring it up directly
- Adjust the agenda when you're running low
- Connect the dots between your health, your stress, and your output
- Tell you when something can wait

## What This Is Not

**Not a todo app.** Todo apps assume tasks are discrete, equal-weight items. Real life has dependencies, energy requirements, emotional weight, and timing constraints.

**Not a habit tracker.** Habit trackers assume consistency is the goal. For some people, flexibility and adaptation matter more than streaks.

**Not a journaling app.** While it captures raw thoughts, the purpose is operational (what should I do?) not purely reflective (how do I feel?). Though reflection emerges from the patterns.

**Not a replacement for human support.** This is a tool. It doesn't replace professional help, coaching, or relationships. It helps you stay organized while you do the real work.

## Who This Is For

- People whose lives don't fit into neat daily routines
- People who think in streams, not structures
- People managing health conditions alongside work
- People in transition (career, location, relationship status)
- People who've tried productivity apps and found them too rigid
- Anyone who wants structure that adapts rather than dictates

## The Bet

The bet is that AI + personal context is the missing piece that makes productivity systems actually work for non-standard lives.

Generic advice ("eat the frog!", "time block!", "inbox zero!") fails because it ignores who you are, where you are, and what you're actually dealing with.

An AI that knows:
- Your current energy and capacity
- Your recent history and patterns
- Your goals and constraints
- What you've been avoiding and why
- When you typically do your best work

...can give you genuinely useful guidance. Not productivity theater. Actual help.

That's the bet.
