"Had a rough morning, stomach acting up again. Probably stress from
the work stuff. Need to call the insurance company about the surgery
but I keep putting it off. Talked to Sarah yesterday and she mentioned
a PM role opening at her company. Should follow up on that. Also my
mom wants me to come visit next weekend."
